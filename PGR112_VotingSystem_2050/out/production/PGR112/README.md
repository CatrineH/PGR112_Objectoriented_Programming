# Student Voting System

This is a simple command-line based student voting system that allows students to nominate candidates, vote for nominees, and add comments to their votes.

# How to Use
## MySQL JDBC Driver

In Java, we need a driver to communicate with a MySQL server.

To download MySQL Server, use the following link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

To access the classes we need, we have to load a package called Connector/J.

### To Install Manually:

 >   Download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

 >  Installation Guide: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-installing.html

---

In this project, we need to manually load Connector/J.

Download a platform-independent .zip folder, place the .zip file into IntelliJ:

File â†’ Project Structure ... and then navigate to Libraries under Project Settings, click on +, choose Java, 
locate the .ZIP file you downloaded, and add it to the project.
